# [Udacity Nano Degree Self Driving Car](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

This repository is for the Udacity Nanodegree Self Driving Car Engineer program.

This is a work in progress.

I ll be updating the repo as I progress through the program.

## Project 1: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

In this project we detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.

## Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding Project

The goal of this project is detect lanes using Computer Vision algorithms (color transforms, gradients, sliding windows).
