# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 
---

The goal of this project is to classify traffic signs using convolution neural networks with the help of [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).


The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
